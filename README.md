Description
-----------------------

Learn your RGB values in this fun application

This project is a static web application with an appealing presentation. There is an easy and hard mode to the game, where easy allows you to guess between only three blocks while hard allows you to guess between six blocks. This project was made with the help of Colt Steele and his Udemy Class "The Web Developer Bootcamp" (url: https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp). Thank you so much, Colt!

This project further helped me gain a solid understanding of the front end side developing web apps and, also, gave me the experience of working with jQuery selectors and events.
